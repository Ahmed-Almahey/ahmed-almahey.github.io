**Excel International Sales Report â€” Global Performance Dashboard**

In todayâ€™s global market, tracking performance across multiple regions is essential for understanding revenue distribution and profitability.  
This Excel dashboard provides **an interactive and automated view of international sales**, helping businesses identify high-performing countries, sales trends, and margin insights.

### Project Overview

The projectâ€™s goal was to design a **data-driven Excel dashboard** that consolidates multi-country sales data into a unified report.  
It allows stakeholders to analyze **regional KPIs**, monitor **sales volume by geography**, and **compare YoY growth** dynamically.

### Data Preparation & Processing

- Imported raw datasets from multiple countries using **Power Query** for automatic data cleaning and merging.  
- Standardized columns such as *Region*, *Product Category*, and *Currency* for consistency.  
- Built a **Date Table** with fiscal month logic and added dynamic filters.  
- Calculated key metrics using **DAX-like Excel formulas** and **Named Ranges** for automation.  
- Modeled the data with relationships between FactSales and dimension tables (Products, Regions, Time).
