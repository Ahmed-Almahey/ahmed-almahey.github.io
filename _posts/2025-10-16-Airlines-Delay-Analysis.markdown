‚úàÔ∏è Airlines Delay Analysis ‚Äî Power BI Project

Flight delays are costly for airlines and frustrating for travelers. I created this Power BI dashboard to uncover the main causes of delays and help visualize where and why they occur.

Using real airline data, I built a star schema model with DAX-based date and location dimensions to support time and geography analysis. I also created a dedicated measures table for KPIs like total delays, average delay duration, and delay types ‚Äî handling many-to-many relationships to ensure accurate reporting.

The dashboard includes maps, bar charts, and trend lines that reveal key insights ‚Äî such as regions most affected by weather, and airlines with the highest carrier-related delays.

This project strengthened my skills in data modeling, DAX, and business storytelling, turning raw flight data into insights that could guide real operational improvements.
