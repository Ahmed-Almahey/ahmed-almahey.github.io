###  SQL Course Tasks at ITI â€” Guided by Eng. Rami Nagi

During my intensive SQL training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), I worked through a series of hands-on database design and programming labs that covered **conceptual modeling, SQL Server development, and database administration**. Each lab simulated real-world scenarios â€” from designing ERDs and normalizing data to implementing advanced queries, stored procedures, triggers, and performance optimization.

These tasks built my foundation for creating **efficient, secure, and scalable databases**, while helping me think like a database architect, not just a developer.

###  Highlights of What I Did and Learned

- Designed **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** for multiple real-world domains â€” music recording systems, hospitals, airlines, and real estate.
- Applied **normalization** to transform unstructured data into optimized relational models.
- Wrote **complex SQL queries** using subqueries, joins, aggregate functions, and ranking functions.
- Practiced **DDL**, **DML**, and **DQL** to manage and manipulate company-level databases.
- Created and used **views**, **functions** (scalar, inline, and table-valued), and **stored procedures**.
- Implemented **triggers** and **audit tables** to enforce integrity and record data modifications.
- Explored **schemas**, **user permissions**, **indexes**, **filegroups**, and **database backups**.
- Worked extensively with **AdventureWorks** and **ITI** databases to apply advanced SQL Server features like ranking, windowing, and security.

*These SQL labs represent the backbone of my understanding of database systems â€” shaping the way I analyze data relationships, optimize performance, and design maintainable database architectures.*
