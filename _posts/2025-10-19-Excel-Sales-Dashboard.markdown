**Excel Sales Dashboard â€” Last Month Analysis**

Businesses need month-over-month insights to track revenue trends and performance.  
I built this Excel dashboard using Power Query, Data Modeling, and PivotTables to compare **Last Month vs Previous Month** sales and reveal key drivers.

### Data Preparation & Modeling

- Loaded **masterdata.xlsx** as a workbook and created connections for Employees, Products, Customers  
- Cleaned and transformed **salesdata.txt** and added a calculated column: `Sales = Qty Ã— Unit Price`  
- Built a **Date Table** with Month, Month Name, Month Flags (Last / Previous)  
- Created a **star schema model** linking Fact Sales to all dimension tables

### Dashboard Insights

The dashboard includes:

- **Month-over-Month Sales** comparison with % change  
- **Top 3 Sales Managers** (Last Month)  
- **Sales by Product Category** with MoM % change  
- **Top 5 Customers** and **Top 5 Employees** (interactive with slicers)  
- **Sales Trend by Month** (formatted in millions with currency)

This simulates a realistic business reporting scenario using Excel as a lightweight BI solution.
