**Tableau â€” Superstore KPI & Profit Performance Analysis**

This Tableau mini-project was built on the **Sample Superstore** dataset as part of my visualization practice.  
The goal was to extract **profitability insights** using calculated fields, KPI indicators, and regional breakdowns.

###  Tasks Covered

1) **Year Over Year Growth Analysis (2014â€“2017)**  
   - Built YoY growth line chart  
   - Used year filter for dynamic exploration  
   - Highlighted max profit point

2) **Split Customer Names Using Calculated Field**  
   - Extracted first & last name using Tableau string functions

3) **KPI Performance Indicator for Profit Ratio**  
   - Based on:
     - Profit Ratio
     - Sub-Category
     - Region  
   - Applied directional indicators (up/down) to interpret results visually
