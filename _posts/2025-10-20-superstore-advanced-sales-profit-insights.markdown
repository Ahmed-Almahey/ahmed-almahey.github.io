**Tableau ‚Äî Superstore Advanced Sales & Profit Insights Dashboard**

This project was part of my final Tableau course under *Dr. Ahmed Ismail (DBA, MBA, PMP, BI)*.  
The goal was to simulate a **real-world business intelligence challenge** ‚Äî building a complete analytical environment from scratch using the famous **Sample Superstore** dataset.

I wanted to demonstrate how to combine **data storytelling, visualization design, and performance analytics** into one cohesive experience that helps managers make better decisions.

###  Project Overview

The project integrates multiple dashboards, advanced chart types, parameters, and a final story presentation ‚Äî all connected through a clean and interactive user experience.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Analyze sales and profit by customer  
2. Forecast future sales  
3. Build a **Waterfall Chart** for subcategory sales  
4. Use a **Lollipop Chart** to visualize category sales  
5. Compare three chosen categories using both **chart and data table**  
6. Add total summaries for the data tables  
7. Create KPI cards (Sales, Profit, Profit Ratio, Quantity, Customer Count)  
8. Develop an interactive **Map Visualization** (Sales & Profit by Region)  
9. Design a **Donut Chart** showing:
   - Total Profit in ‚ÄúK‚Äù with `$` symbol  
   - Region share as % of total profit  
10. Use **Sets** to highlight top and bottom profit segments  
11. Link **Orders vs. Returns** through a line chart (sub-category level)  
12. Add a **Parameter** to switch between KPIs dynamically  
13. Build **Product Dashboard** (Category, Name, Region, State)  
14. Create a **Linked Overview Dashboard** combining all insights  
15. Build a **Story Dashboard** for key findings (Forecast, Lollipop, Donut, Sets)

###  What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:
- Use **advanced Tableau visualizations** (Lollipop, Waterfall, Donut, etc.)  
- Implement **forecasting and KPI analysis** effectively  
- Leverage **sets, parameters, and filters** for deeper insights  
- Design **interactive, multi-dashboard experiences**  
- Apply **data storytelling techniques** for executive presentations  

This experience helped me refine the way I approach dashboard projects ‚Äî moving from individual visuals to **complete analytical stories** that connect metrics with meaning.
