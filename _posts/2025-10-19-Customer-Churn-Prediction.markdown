**Customer Churn Prediction â€” End-to-End Project**

Churn has a direct financial impact on businesses â€” losing customers is more expensive than keeping them.  
I built this app to simulate how a business could predict churn in real time and act before the customer leaves.

###  Business Problem & Goal

The goal was to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic and usage attributes.  
This enables companies to launch retention campaigns *before* revenue is lost.

###  What I Built

- Preprocessed and encoded categorical features (Gender, Churn)
- Trained a **Naive Bayes** classifier and evaluated it with accuracy & confusion matrix
- Built and deployed an **interactive Streamlit app** that predicts churn in real time
- Prepared a clean GitHub repo with structure, code & documentation

###  What I Learned

This project strengthened my skills in:
- Turning raw data into a deployable ML solution
- Building user-facing ML apps, not just notebooks
- Thinking from a business perspective, not only technically
