# Hi! I'm Ahmed Almahey

my path began with a love for mathematics and problem-solving, which led me to teaching. For years, I helped students simplify complex ideas, sharpening my analytical and communication skills. Over time, I realized what I truly enjoyed was analyzing patterns and making sense of data. That passion guided me to shift my career into data analytics and business intelligence, where I combine logic, creativity, and technology to uncover insights that drive impact.

I’m deeply curious about how things work — from technology and cosmology to historical and fantasy movies about great thinkers and imaginative worlds. I also enjoy football and exploring how mathematics and technology shape our understanding of life. That curiosity keeps me inspired to learn, experiment, and grow every day.

I’m seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst or BI Developer to apply my technical skills and passion for data in creating meaningful insights. My long-term goal is to advance toward data engineering, blending it with analytics to design smarter, integrated systems. I’m eager to join a team that values learning, curiosity, and impact — and to turn information into intelligence.
